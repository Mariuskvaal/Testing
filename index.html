    <h1>Testing project</h1>
    <h3>Testing the combination with VSC,Github and Netifly</h3>
<p>This is a testing project to see if everything works okey. It's a little bit confusing, but i think i will get the hang of it if i just watch some youtube videos and read some articles</p>
<p>It could also be that my broken hip will not let me consentrait true this project. Because when i was ice skating there was this shit kid that knew karate. He was mad at me because i stole his ice cream so he beat the shit out of me. thats the story of my life </p>
